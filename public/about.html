<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> 
  I am from Greece and in particular from the city of Corinth. But not the ancient city of Corinth, but in the new city.
   A very sunny place near the sea with very warm Summers and mild Winters

<p>
  I am a computer gamer at heart, but also a gamer in general (consoles not excluded)
</p>
<p>
  I have studied computer programming and i am good at learning new languages and problem solving
